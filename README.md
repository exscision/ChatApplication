# ChatApplication
Chat Application Project - Database Programming

### Description
This is a chat application designed in Database Programming class. 
We were asked to make a chat application with the following guidelines. 

```
The form will have a login: email and password.
  a.	If the email exists in the DB:
      i.	If password matches the DB – login
      ii.	Else – return “password incorrect” error
  b.	Else – register as new user.

Once logged in, all messages will be recorded with the user name that wrote them, and the time it was written.
A unique Id should be recorded for each message, to describe the system it came from.  
For example: Elad-PC, or your Mac Address.
Messages will be displayed by the order they were sent, with the latest one next to the text box.

Send an Email to every new user
```
